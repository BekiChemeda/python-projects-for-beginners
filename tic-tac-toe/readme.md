## Tic tac Toe

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid, aiming to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game.

### How it works:
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid. 
2. Taking players input alternately, the game marks 'X' for Player 1 and 'O' for Player 2.
3. check win or tie 
4. switch turns 
5. check win or tie after every move
